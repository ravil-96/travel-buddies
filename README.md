 ### troubleshooting
 If you are getting error messages about `wait-for-it.sh` file, particulalrly Mac users
 you'll need to check the file has the right permissioins (it should have an x at the end) by running `ls -lah`. You may need to run 
 `chmod +x wait-for-it.sh` and check by running `ls -lah` again.
